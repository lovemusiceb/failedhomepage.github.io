I earned my Ph.D. in Computer Science from Sun Yat-sen University, specializing in human parsing, person image composition, and operating systems. Currently, I serve as a lecturer at the School of Computer Science and Information Engineering at Nanning Normal University, where I am dedicated to teaching and advancing research in my field.
